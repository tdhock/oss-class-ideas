Ideas for students of https://github.com/igorsteinmacher/CS499-2018
- For a student with C++ skills, also interested in R package
  development. See
  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/Segmentor3IsBack
- For a student who wants to work on a machine learning R package with
  C++ coding. https://github.com/anujkhare/iregnet/pull/54 needs some
  C++ debugging -- why do we get NAN errors when there are only a few
  distinct values of features? After merging that PR, getting the
  package ready for CRAN submission would be great.
- For a student who is interested in coding an optimization algorithm
  in pure R code. [[http://github.com/tdhock/directlabels]] is an R
  package for label positioning in plots. Code a replacement for the
  [[http://directlabels.r-forge.r-project.org/docs/utility.function/posfuns/qp.labels.html][qp.labels]] function that solves the Quadratic Program but does NOT
  depend on quadprog (thus avoiding a dependency on compiled code).
  [[http://directlabels.r-forge.r-project.org/docs/lineplot/posfuns/first.polygons.html][example of plot labels which use this function]].
- For somebody who knows a little R and would like to help writing
  documentation. https://github.com/tdhock/animint is an R package for
  *anim*ated *int*eractive graphics and there I wrote an extensive
  Designer Manual at
  http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/animint-book/Ch02-ggplot2.html. We
  have a new backwards-incompatible version of the package
  https://github.com/tdhock/animint2 which has fewer dependencies and
  is thus easier to install, but we haven't yet ported the Designer
  Manual to the new package syntax. That would be the goal of this
  project, source code of the Manual is here
  https://github.com/tdhock/animint-book
- For somebody with JavaScript coding skills, who wants to work on
  interactive graphics, see ideas list here
  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/Animated-interactive-ggplots
- For somebody with a windows
  machine. https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDisk is an R package
  implementing a fast dynamic programming algorithm for genomic data
  analysis. Right now it is installable from github, and I have tested
  on several GNU/Linux and Mac systems. But we eventually want to put it on
  CRAN, in which case it would be good if it works on windows as
  well. Set up [[https://www.appveyor.com/][AppVeyor]] with a windows test environment to do the same
  tests as we already have on Travis.
- For somebody with C++ coding experience. Re-write the C++ code in
  https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegDisk so that it still works,
  but no longer depends on Berkeley DB (which seems to be a pain to
  install on many systems so this would make the package more
  portable).
- For somebody interested in cluster computing. Currently
  https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegPipeline has support for
  parallelization on a cluster with qsub. However at NAU on monsoon we
  have another system/program for cluster job submission, sbatch. This
  project would be to support both. Two ideas about how to do that:
  - [[https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/issues/204][batchtools]] is the R interface to cluster systems, but it does not
    support dependencies between jobs. Dependencies are needed in
    order to simultaneously launch all [[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegPipeline#running-steps-of-the-pipeline-in-parallel][seven steps]]. Currently it seems
    like batchtools does not support dependencies -- maybe this project
    could implement support for dependencies in batchtools? 
  - Otherwise you can use [[https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes][GenPipes]] which is a python library that
    generates shell scripts. It supports dependencies between
    jobs. I have already created [[https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/pull-requests/18/supervised-chipseq/diff][a PR]] which I suggest you add to.
  - Right now TEST_SUITE=pipeline-* on [[https://travis-ci.org/tdhock/PeakSegPipeline][Travis-CI]] just runs the R
    pipeline() function, but it would be great if you could install
    SLURM on the CI virtual machine, and test the actual job
    submission code (with dependencies).
- For somebody with C coding experience, or who wants to just help fix
  issues in a big project. Fix some issues in [[https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki][data.table]] which is one
  of the most-used R packages. Here is a description from the primary
  author Matt Dowle
  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/data.table
