Ideas for students of https://github.com/igorsteinmacher/CS499-2018
- For a student with C++ skills, also interested in R package
  development. See
  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/Segmentor3IsBack
- For a student who is interested in optimization
  algorithms. [[http://github.com/tdhock/directlabels]] is an R package
  for label positioning in plots. Code a replacement for the [[http://directlabels.r-forge.r-project.org/docs/utility.function/posfuns/qp.labels.html][qp.labels]]
  function that solves the Quadratic Program but does NOT depend on
  quadprog (thus avoiding a dependency on compiled code).
- For somebody who knows a little R and would like to help writing
  documentation. https://github.com/tdhock/animint is an R package for
  *anim*ated *int*eractive graphics and there I wrote an extensive
  Designer Manual at
  http://members.cbio.mines-paristech.fr/~thocking/animint-book/Ch02-ggplot2.html. We
  have a new backwards-incompatible version of the package
  https://github.com/tdhock/animint2 which has fewer dependencies and
  is thus easier to install, but we haven't yet ported the Designer
  Manual to the new package syntax. That would be the goal of this
  project, source code of the Manual is here
  https://github.com/tdhock/animint-book
- For somebody with JavaScript coding skills, who wants to work on
  interactive graphics, see ideas list here
  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/Animated-interactive-ggplots
- For somebody with C coding experience, or who wants to just help fix
  issues in a big project. Fix some issues in [[https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki][data.table]] which is one
  of the most-used R packages. Here is a description from the primary
  author Matt Dowle
  https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2018/wiki/data.table
- For somebody with a windows
  machine. https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegPipeline is an R package
  implementing some machine learning algorithms for genomic data
  classification. Right now it is installable from github, and I have
  tested on several GNU/Linux systems. But we eventually want to put
  it on CRAN, in which case it would be good if it works on windows as
  well. Set up [[https://www.appveyor.com/][AppVeyor]] with a windows test environment to do the same
  tests as we already have on Travis. 
- For somebody with C++ coding experience. Re-write the C++ code in
  https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegPipeline so that it still works,
  but no longer depends on Berkeley DB (which seems to be a pain to
  install on many systems so this would make the package more
  portable).
- For somebody interested in cluster computing. Currently
  https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegPipeline has support for
  parallelization on a cluster with qsub. However at NAU on monsoon we
  have another system/program for cluster job submission, sbatch. This
  project would be to re-write the PeakSegPipeline code in order to
  support both. Two ideas about how to do that: (1) [[https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes][GenPipes]] (2)
  [[https://github.com/mllg/batchtools/issues/204][batchtools]]. Would be best to have dependencies between jobs, as
  documented on the steps in the PeakSegPipeline README. Currently it
  seems like batchtools does not support dependencies -- maybe this
  project could implement support for dependencies in batchtools?
